# AI Learning Modules for Traffic Engineers

Welcome to our AI Learning series designed specifically for traffic engineers. These modules aim to introduce the basics of machine learning and deep learning, apply these techniques to traffic engineering, and evaluate real-world applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the necessary software installed on your machine, or you can use the Google Colab platform, which supports our tutorials without any installation requirements. 

- **Software Installation**: Follow our detailed installation guide to set up your environment.
- **Google Colab**: A flexible platform that eliminates the need for local installations. Access our tutorials directly in your browser.

## Module Overview

### 1. Basic Knowledge
Understand the foundational concepts of machine learning and deep learning, crucial for mastering further AI techniques in traffic engineering.

- **Content**: Dive into key concepts using the Jupyter Notebook. Access the notebook [https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_0_basic_knowledge.ipynb](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_0_basic_knowledge.ipynb).

### 2. Optimization Techniques
Learn about optimization algorithms that can be applied to traffic flow, signal timing, and resource allocation.

- **Content**: Explore practical exercises and solutions in the dedicated Jupyter Notebook. Access the notebook [https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_1_optimization.ipynb](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_1_optimization.ipynb).

### 3. Time Series Analysis
Master the art of analyzing time-series data to predict traffic patterns and make data-driven decisions for traffic management.

- **Content**: Apply learned techniques on real-world traffic data with our comprehensive guide. Access the notebook [https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_2_time_series.ipynb](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_2_time_series.ipynb).

## Case Studies and Real-World Applications

Objectives:
- **Apply** learned techniques to real-world scenarios.
- **Evaluate** the effectiveness of AI models in practical traffic applications.

### Hands-On Tutorial Using Google Colab

- **Google Colab Tutorial**: For a detailed guide on using Google Colab, refer to our tutorial document [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/google_colab/what_is_google_colab.htm).
- **Additional Resources**: [Jupyter Notebook Introduction](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) and [Virtual Machine Guide](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/virtual-machine.html).

### Get Started

- [Start with Google Colab](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/OSM2GMNS/blob/master/osm2gmns_quickstart.ipynb): Begin with installing packages, downloading data, and setting up your first project on traffic analysis.

We look forward to seeing you apply AI to enhance traffic engineering solutions effectively!
