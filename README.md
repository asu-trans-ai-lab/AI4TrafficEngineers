# AI Learning Modules for Traffic Engineers

Welcome to our AI Learning series designed specifically for traffic engineers. These modules aim to introduce the basics of machine learning and deep learning, apply these techniques to traffic engineering, and evaluate real-world applications.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the necessary software installed on your machine, or you can use the Google Colab platform, which supports our tutorials without any installation requirements. 

- **Software Installation**: Follow our detailed installation guide to set up your environment.
- **Google Colab**: A flexible platform that eliminates the need for local installations. Access our tutorials directly in your browser.

## Module Overview

### 1. Basic Knowledge
Understand the foundational concepts of machine learning and deep learning, crucial for mastering further AI techniques in traffic engineering.

- **Content**: Dive into key concepts using the Jupyter Notebook. Access the notebook [https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_0_basic_knowledge.ipynb](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_0_basic_knowledge.ipynb).

### 2. Optimization Techniques
Learn about optimization algorithms that can be applied to traffic flow, signal timing, and resource allocation.

- **Content**: Explore practical exercises and solutions in the dedicated Jupyter Notebook. Access the notebook [https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_1_optimization.ipynb](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_1_optimization.ipynb).

### 3. Time Series Analysis
Master the art of analyzing time-series data to predict traffic patterns and make data-driven decisions for traffic management.

- **Content**: Apply learned techniques on real-world traffic data with our comprehensive guide. Access the notebook [https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_2_time_series.ipynb](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/AI4TrafficEngineers/blob/main/Traffic_AI_2_time_series.ipynb).

### 4. Video Analysis with Gemini

![Run in Colab](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/use-cases/video-analysis/video_analysis.ipynb)  
**Platform**: Google Cloud Colab Enterprise

**Open in Vertex AI Workbench**: 

**Author(s)**: Holt Skinner

#### Getting Started

- **Install Vertex AI SDK for Python**: Follow the installation guide to set up the necessary tools for video analysis.

> **Note**: Due to the length of the video, this process will take a few minutes to complete.

**Additional Notes**

This module is designed to enhance your understanding of machine learning with a focus on image recognition and video processing, even with limited hardware resources. The tutorial leverages a neural network from the **Mask_R-CNN repository**, which provides an implementation of a convolutional neural network using Python3, TensorFlow, and Keras.

For a concise guide on setting up Google Colaboratory for video processing and further details on using neural networks for image processing, refer to this comprehensive article:
[How to Use Google Colaboratory for Video Processing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-google-colaboratory-for-video-processing/).


### 5. Case Studies and Real-World Applications


Objectives:
- **Apply** learned techniques to real-world scenarios using open street maps (https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/3766483)
- **Evaluate** the effectiveness of AI models in practical traffic applications.
